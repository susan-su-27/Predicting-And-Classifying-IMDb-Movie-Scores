Predicting and Classifying IMDb Movie Scores

Institution: Fanshawe College, Canada | Role: Student – AI & Machine Learning Program

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn

Project Overview:
An academic project focused on predicting and classifying IMDb movie ratings to compare the performance of baseline machine learning models against deep learning approaches.

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:
Utilized the IMDb Movie Ratings dataset from Kaggle to train and evaluate multiple regression and classification models.
Implemented Linear Regression and MLP Regression models for continuous score prediction, evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
Developed Logistic Regression and MLP Classification models to classify movies by rating categories, evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve model generalization and performance consistency.
